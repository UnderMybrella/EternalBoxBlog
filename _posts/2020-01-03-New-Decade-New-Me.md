So the 2020s have hit, and with them a new announcement for the Eternal Jukebox - we're getting (another) rewrite!

<!-- more -->

The code right now is a bit of a mess, and there have been a number of things that have made maintenance difficult. But most importantly, existing services keep making moves to block our work.

Crazy, right? Almost like YouTube doesn't like people downloading their videos.

This, coupled with a few new developments (YouTube Music *sort of* having an Api, for instance), have lead me to write a near-total rewrite of the EternalBox.

So, what does this mean? Let's establish a timeline.

1. As of right now, the current version of the site is going into maintenance mode; nothing should break, but just be aware new songs may not work right now!
2. In addition, a new version of the site is available for [Patreon supporters](https://patreon.com/undermybrella) to access.
3. Development should complete by February 1st, and once it is complete the new site will be unlocked and hosted separately.
4. After two weeks of site usage, if the rewritten engine performs well, and feedback is positive, then the rewrite will replace the main site. The current version of the site will be available for a short while after.
5. Two weeks after that, the current version of the site will be permanently retired. 

Currently, the new site is pretty barebones in functionality, but it's slowly being added in. Patrons that are on the [Discord server](/invite) have a channel they can use to check in on how everything's going.

However, while I've been focusing on talking about the backend server, there's another component that's getting overhauled - the front facing website.

I've finally bitten the bullet - so to speak - and begun rewriting the JavaScript code that powers the Jukebox itself. At the moment it's just a 1:1 port from JavaScript to Kotlin, however this will allow me to narrow down what's needed, and add new functionality in a bit easier.

I'll also hopefully be changing the default theme too, but not to fear - the retro theme with retro JavaScript will still be available.

Hopefully, this rewrite brings some good, much needed, progress to the EternalBox. *Tune* in next time, when I hopefully have some key updates on our progress.
